# Huffman Coding Project
The Huffman Coding Project will help you with data compression and decompression. Even though disk space is alot cheaper now than ever before in history, there are still importance in efficiently and effectively compress information. It is possible to make a file significantly smaller without any loss of information whatsoever, leading to lossless compression. The Huffman coding was a technique introduced by David Huffman 1952. Huffman coding compression is still used today as part of JPEG image compression, mp3 audio compression, Unix file compression command pack, and other applications. 

## Getting Started
These instructions will guide you on how to grab the repo, and use the huffman coding project to start compression and decompression files. 

### Grab the Repo

First we need to clone this repo
1. Open Terminal 
2. cd into the directory where you want to copy the repo 
3. clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/mdcovarr/huffman_code.git
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
